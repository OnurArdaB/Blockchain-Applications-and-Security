The dice rolling game is simple and fair:
1) the player puts a bet (a maximum of 0.1 ETH), 
2) a dice is rolled, 
3) if it is less than 4 the house wins, otherwise the player wins. 

Design and implement a smart contract to play the role of the house (in fact, the contract is owned by the house).  
To play the game, the players must have an account stored on the contract - their names, ages, and balances must be kept there.  They must be able to withdraw/deposit money from/to their accounts.
When the balance on the contract is reduced, the house must be able to deposit money.
The money on the contract must be sent to house if needed. 

Be as efficient and secure as possible. Heavily comment the code to describe why you implemented the function like that. State potential security weaknesses and how the code solves these.

Report the gas usage of your functions on top of their implementations.
